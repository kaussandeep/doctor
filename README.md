This project uses http-server to setup a front end
 To Setup
 
 1.) After cloning run  `npm install`  or `npm install -g http-server`
 2.) Go to package.json and in scripts- > start -> change the path to the project
 3.) run `npm start` . This would start the server at a localhost port (maybe 8080 or 8082)
 4.) Go localhost:port and enter the ISO Code of the country and you will see the statistics
 
 
 There are 2 implementations 
 1.) Jquery AJAX  (main.js)
 2.) XMLHttpRequest (main2.js)
 
 By default the project is running XML HttpRequest, but you can change it in `index.html`
 
 What can go wrong ?
 1.) Make sure you enter the path to your cloned location correctly.
